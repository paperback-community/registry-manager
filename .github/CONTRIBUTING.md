### Development and Build Process

#### Commands

Check the [`Makefile`](MakeFile) for available commands and [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml) for configurable features.

#### .env File Structure

The default [`Makefile`](Makefile) command uses the `dotenv` feature, allowing you to configure environment variables during development with a `.env` file:

```env
TOKEN=
REPOSITORY=
BRANCH=
COMMIT_MESSAGE=
COMMIT_AUTHOR_NAME=
COMMIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=
LOG_LEVEL=
```
