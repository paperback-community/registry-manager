## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question yourself, it is best to search for existing [Q&A discussions](https://github.com/paperback-community/registry-manager/discussions/categories/q-a) that might help you, you can always continue an already existing discussion. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers. In case you didn't find a suitable answer, you can create a Q&A discussion yourself:

1. Open a [Q&A Discussion](https://github.com/paperback-community/registry-manager/discussions/new?category=q-a).
2. Give it a clear title and make sure to provide all relevant information.

We will then take care of the Q&A discussion as soon as possible.

You may always ask us questions through our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/paperback-community) as well.

## Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for the registry manager. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your report and find related ones.

### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for moregistry managermation. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

1. Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side (e.g. a misconfigured YAML file).
2. Make sure to search the internet to see if users outside of the GitHub Community have discussed the issue.
3. To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same bug you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/paperback-community/registry-manager/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aunconfirmed-bug+label%3Abug). If there is, add a comment to the existing one instead of opening a new one.
4. Collect the following information about the bug:
    - Device OS
    - Device chipset
    - Bug description
    - Bug replication steps

### Submitting a Good Bug Report

Bug reports are tracked as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/paperback-community/registry-manager/issues). To submit a new bug report:

2. Fill in the template and provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it is filed:

1. A team member will try to reproduce the bug with your provided steps. Bug reports without (clear) reproduction steps will not be addressed until they can be reproduced.
2. If the team is able to reproduce the bug a fix will be left to be [implemented by someone](https://github.com/paperback-community/registry-manager/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

You may always make bug reports through our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/paperback-community) as well (using the #support channel).

## Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for the registry manager, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related ones.

### Before Submitting an Enhancement Suggestion

A good enhancement suggestion shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us consider any enhancement suggestion as fast as possible.

1. Find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
2. Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this enhancement. Keep in mind that we want enhancements that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset.
3. To see if other users have suggested the same enhancement, check if there is not already a feature enhancement related to yours existing in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/paperback-community/registry-manager/issues?q=label%3Aenhancement). If there is, add a comment to the existing one instead of opening a new one.

### Submitting a Good Enhancement Suggestion

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/paperback-community/registry-manager/issues). To submit a new enhancement suggestion:

1. Open an Enhancement Suggestion [issue](https://github.com/paperback-community/registry-manager/issues/new?template=enhancement).
